Welcome to FactoBASE!, a completely useless numbering system.  No, really, I can't think of a single thing that it's actually good for and it's not intuitive or convenient to use.  "Well, why did you bother then?" I can hear you asking.  It's quite simple really, it thoroughly amused me.  Still does, apparently, if I'm making this for you to read.  Like anything worthwhile, FactoBASE! is the result of a combination of boredom and trying to avoid doing real work.  It was born when a friend and I spent way too much time proposing absurd numbering schemes, and now refuses to die.  I hope one of you out there finds some measure of amusement from it as I have.  I still can't believe I'm doing this.

See if you can figure out why it has its name.
